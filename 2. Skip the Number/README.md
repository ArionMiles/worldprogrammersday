# Skip the Number

## Problem
Teacher has given a task to find the fibonacci series to Raju. Raju is a smart and he finds the solution. In challenge, Teacher has given another task to print the alternate number from the series.

Fibonacci Series:

`n[i]=n[i-1]+n[i-2]`

e.g.

```
0
1 
1 (0+1)
2 (1+1)
3 (1+2)
5 (2+3)
8 (3+5)
so on
```

## Input Format
Single line Integer Input N

## Constraints
1 <= N <= 50

## Output Format
Alternate Number from Fibonacci Series, separated by space

## Sample Input 0
```
10
```

## Sample Output 0
```
0 1 3 8 21
```
