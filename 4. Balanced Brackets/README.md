# Balanced Brackets

## Problem
A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: `(, ), {, }, [, or ].`

Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., `(`, `[`, or `{`) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., `)`, `]`, or `}`) of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: `[]`, `{}`, and `()`.

A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. For example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents in between { and } are not balanced. The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, `(`, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, `]`.

By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is balanced if the following conditions are met:

 - It contains no unmatched brackets.
 - The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.

Given `n` strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, return `YES`. Otherwise, return `NO`.

### Function Description

Complete the function _isBalanced_ in the editor below. It must return a string: `YES` if the sequence is balanced or `NO` if it is not.

`isBalanced` has the following parameter(s):

- s: a string of brackets

## Input Format
The first line contains a single integer `n`, the number of strings.
Each of the next `n` lines contains a single string , a sequence of brackets.

## Constraints
- 1 <= n <= 10<sup>3</sup>
- 1 <= |s| <= 10<sup>3</sup>, where |s| is the length of the sequence.
- All chracters in the sequences âˆˆ { `{, }, (, ), [, ]` }.

## Output Format
For each string, return YES or NO.

## Sample Input 0
```
3
{[()]}
{[(])}
{{[[(())]]}}
```

## Sample Output 0
```
YES
NO
YES
```
## Explanation

1. The string `{[()]}` meets both criteria for being a balanced string, so we print YES on a new line.
2. The string `{[(])}` is not balanced because the brackets enclosed by the matched pair { and } are not balanced: [(]).
3. The string `{{[[(())]]}}` meets both criteria for being a balanced string, so we print YES on a new line.
